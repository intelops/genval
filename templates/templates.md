# Templates

The templates within this directory contains few sample files required as arguments to the `genval` tool. It contains folders for default policies and default inputs one can use out of the box for validation and genaration capabilities of the Genval, facilitating the validation and generation of Dockerfiles for different programming languages, and Kubernetes resources using rego and Cue respectively..


Should you identify any opportunities to enhance the existing sample input files or policy files for both rego and Cue, we wholeheartedly welcome user contributions through Pull Requests (PRs) :). Furthermore, if you require additional functionality, we encourage you to modify the existing files to align with your specific needs. And if, by any chance, the directory lacks some inputs or policies for your choice, we kindly invite you to contribute and expand our offerings in this directory.
