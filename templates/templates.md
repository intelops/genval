# Templates

The templates within this directory serve as sample input for the `genval` tool, facilitating the generation of Dockerfiles for various programming languages. Each file in this directory is prefixed with the language for which the input JSON file is intended, subsequently generating a Dockerfile tailored to that specific language. For instance, `golang-input.json` is used to create a Dockerfile for Go applications, and so forth. These JSON files have been meticulously crafted in accordance with Dockerfile best practices and stringent security standards.

Should you identify any opportunities to enhance the existing sample input files, we wholeheartedly welcome user contributions through Pull Requests (PRs) :). Furthermore, if you require additional functionality, we encourage you to modify the existing input JSON files to align with your specific needs. And if, by any chance, the directory lacks a sample Dockerfile for a language of your choice, we kindly invite you to contribute and expand our offerings in this directory.
